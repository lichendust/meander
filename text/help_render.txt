The first option of any flag listed below is also the default, which means it does not need to be specified unless performing an override.

Note that for maximum compatibility, "paper" and "format" should *not* be the first entries in the title page.  Most parsers will reject the entire title page if the first entry is unknown to them, but will quietly skip later ones.  This is never a guarantee, but it may be useful.
