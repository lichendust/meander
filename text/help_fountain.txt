$1Fountain Cheat Sheet$0
--------------------

$1Scene Headings$0
--------------

Scene headings are lines that begin with $1INT$0 or $1EXT$0.  All of the following words can also be used, followed directly by a space or a full-stop.

    INT
    EXT
    EST
    INT./EXT
    INT/EXT
    I/E
    SCENE

They are not required to be uppercase to be recognised, though Meander will convert them to uppercase in all default printing templates.

Unconventional scene headings can also be forced by leading them with a single full-stop.  Multiple full-stops (like an ...ellipsis) are ignored.

    $1.$0BINOCULAR POV       


$1Scene Numbers$0
-------------

Scenes can also have manually defined scene numbers by placing them between two pound signs:
    
    INT. HOUSE - DAY $1#1#$0
    INT. HOUSE - DAY $1#1A#$0
    INT. HOUSE - DAY $1#1a#$0
    INT. HOUSE - DAY $1#A1#$0
    INT. HOUSE - DAY $1#I-1-A#$0
    INT. HOUSE - DAY $1#1.#$0


$1Action$0
------

An Action is what Fountain calls a simple paragraph, or basically any passage that isn't recognised as another element.  In Action elements, Fountain respects whitespace and assumes every carriage return is intentional.

Tabs and spaces are also retained in Action elements, allowing writers to indent a line.  Tabs are converted to four spaces.

All this means that writing the following (including indentation) would be converted exactly to the printed page:

        Scott --

        Jacob Billups
        Palace Hotel, RM 412
        1:00 pm tomorrow

You can also force an Action element can by preceding it with an exclamation point $1!$0


$1Character$0
---------

A Character element is any line entirely in uppercase, with one empty line before it and without an empty line after it.

    STEEL
    The man's a myth!

Characters can be indented for legibility in text, but most Fountain tools will automatically position them when printing.

Character names must begin with and include at least one letter, so $1A113$0 would be recognised as a valid character name.

You can also force a Character by preceding it with $1@$0, used for names that require lowercase letters or some non-Latin alphabets.

    $1@$0McCLANE
    Yippie ki-yay!


$1Character Extensions$0
--------------------

Character extensions are parenthetical notations that follow a character name on the same line.  These may be upper or lowercase.

    MOM (O. S.)
    Luke! Come down for supper!

    HANS (on the radio)
    What was it you said?


$1Parenthetical$0
-------------

Parentheticals follow a Character or Dialogue element, and are wrapped in $1(parentheses)$0.
    
    STEEL
    (starting the engine)
    So much for retirement!


$1Dialogue$0
--------

Dialogue is any text following a Character or Parenthetical element and ends on a linebreak.

    DAN
    Then let's retire them.
    Permanently.


$1Dual Dialogue$0
-------------

Dual, or simultaneous, dialogue is expressed by adding a caret ^ after the second Character element.

    BRICK
    Screw retirement.

    STEEL ^
    Screw retirement.

Any number of spaces between the Character name and the caret are acceptable, and will be ignored. All that matters is that the caret is the last character on the line.


$1Lyrics$0
------

Lyrics are lines with a tilde $1~$0

    ~Willy Wonka! Willy Wonka! The amazing chocolatier!
    ~Willy Wonka! Willy Wonka! Everybody give a cheer!

Meander will style these like Dialogue (regardless of proximity to other dialogue elements) and italicise them.


$1Transition$0
----------

Transitions are uppercase items ending in $1TO:$0 with blank lines before and after:

    $1CUT TO:$0

You can also force any line to be a transition by beginning it with a greater-than symbol $1>$0

    $1> Burn to White$0


$1Centered Text$0
-------------

Centered text is bracketed with greater/less-than:

    $1>$0 THE END $1<$0

Spaces between the greater/less-than symbols and the target text are ignored.


$1Emphasis$0
--------

Fountain inherits Markdown's rules for emphasis, except that it reserves the use of underscores for underlining, something that web-focused Markdown has no need for.

    $1*$0italics$1*$0
    $1**$0bold$1**$0
    $1***$0bold italics$1***$0
    $1_$0underline$1_$0

Meander also extends the core Fountain specification.

    $1~~$0strikethrough$1~~$0
    $1+$0highlight$1+$0

You can mix and match to combine all of the above.

If you need to use any asterisks or underscores as verbatim text, they can be escaped with backslashes:

    $1\*$09765$1\*$0

The position of the formatting characters is also important, in that they should "hug" the target text and not leave "odd" spacing:

    This will become $1*$0italic$1*$0.
    This will not become$1*$0 italic$1*$0.

Also as with Markdown, emphasis does not extend beyond line breaks.  This means a single formatter does not need to be escaped on a given line.


$1Title Page$0
----------

The optional Title Page is always the first thing in a Fountain document. Information is encoded in the format $1key: value$0. Keys can have spaces (like $1Draft Date$0), but must end with a colon.

    Title:
        _**Birdman**_
        *or*
        **(The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)**
    Credit: by
    Author:
        Alejandro G. Iñárritu
        Nicolás Giacobone
        Alexander Dinelaris Jr.
        Armando Bó

As you can see, entering multiple lines in an entry can be done by indenting them beneath a key.

In Meander, the following keys are respected:

    [Center of Page]
    Title
    Credit
    Author
    Source

    [Bottom Left]
    Contact
    Copyright
    Notes

    [Bottom Right]
    Revision
    Draft Date

The Fountain specification also calls for unrecognised keys to be ignored, which most tools do, with the typical caveat that the first key must be one of the above standard ones.

Meander is no different, ignoring any trailing keys that other tools may implement, and indeed adds several custom ones of its own:

    Paper
    Format

These allow the user to simply specify their choice of template and paper size without needing to always enter it in the command parameters.

    Header
    Footer

The document's intended header and footer can be declared as part of the title page, assuming you do not need it to change throughout the document.  This is useful for compatibility with other Fountain tools (or Final Draft import) while still being able to use the feature.

    More Tag: (more)
    Cont Tag: (CONT'D)

You can also override the (more) and (cont'd) tags used when dialogue is broken across a page boundary.  You should specify them inclusive of brackets.


$1Page Breaks$0
-----------

Page Breaks are indicated by a line containing three or more consecutive equals signs, and nothing more.

    $1===$0


$1Punctuation$0
-----------

The core Fountain spec doesn't do any of that, because the screenplay typographical convention is to emulate a typewriter.  However you type your apostrophes, quotes, dashes, and dots, that's how they'll wind up in the screenplay.


$1Indentation$0
-----------

Tabbed or spaced indentation is ignored by Fountain and treated as if they were not there.

This means you can manually indent your character dialogue, should you choose to do so, and Meander will have no trouble reading it.

                SOME DUDE
            (angry)
        Hey!  That's my waffle!

The exception to this is in Action elements, as aforementioned, where indentation is respected.


$1Meander's Syntax Extensions$0
---------------------------

Meander extends the core Fountain syntax with some of its own features and some borrowed from other screenwriting tools.


$1Modifiers$0
---------

$1Includes$0

    include: scenes/01_02.fountain

Include imports the contents of another file at the current location.

The path is always relative to the file in which the include is written.

$1Headers and Footers$0

    header: *My Novel*
    footer: Jannes Authorsson

Meander lets you specify page headers and footers in much the same way.  If you just want one consistent arrangement for the entire file, you can specify the header/footer in the title page.  Alternatively, they can be updated in the text using the same syntax.

You can also control the positioning of elements with pipe characters.  Each pipe-separated section will appear on the left, middle or right of the page respectively:

    header: left | centre | right
    header: left | right
    footer: | centre only |
    footer: | left only

Headers and footers can be entirely stopped by leaving them them empty —

    header:

You can set a header anywhere in the text, but it will only take effect on the following page: set a new header before a manual page-break then.

Headers and footers are also valid title page elements in Meander, so if you're just setting one for the entire document, feel free to set them there; useful for using the feature while maintaining compatibility.

$1Counters$0

Sometimes, numerical counters are useful for tracking values across a screenplay, independently of say, the scene numbers or the page count.

Meander's syntax for this is a pound sign $1#$0 followed by a keyword of your choice.  This word should be made of only letters and underscores and is written in ALL CAPS by convention —

    There are $1#COUNTER$0 apples in the box.

You can also begin/reset any counter to an arbitrary value —

    #COUNTER:10

You can also employ alphabetical counters, by initialising them with a letter —

    #COUNTER:A

There are also a small number of built-in counters that are available to use.  None of these counters may be modified or reset —

    $1#PAGE$0       the current page number.

    $1#SCENE$0      the current scene number (only
                available when using generative
                scene numbers)

    $1#WORDCOUNT$0  the total word count

In fact, the default header in any new Meander document is defined like so —

    header: | #PAGE.
