    meander $1merge$0 input_file [output]

Merge collapses a multi-file screenplay with include directives into a single text file.

If the output is unspecified, Meander will save the result with a suffix to prevent clobbering the original file.  You can forcibly overwrite the original by manually specifing it as both arguments.

$1Include Directive$0
-----------------

In Highland-flavoured Fountain, an include directive allows linking to the contents of another file.  This allows writing a film with each scene in a separate file, or a manuscript by chapters.

Includes take the form:

    $1{{include: some/file.fountain}}$0

The path to the included file should be relative to the file in which the directive is written.

They can be specified anywhere in text and can be nested in multiple layers of children.  Critically, because of this nested infinity, there is no cycle-safety.  Meander will get stuck if a loop between included files is created.
