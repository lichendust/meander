    meander $1convert$0 input_file [output]

Convert will take a number of other screenwriting tools' proprietary formats and (with best practices and within reason) convert them to a plain-text Fountain file.

$1Supported Formats$0

    PDF             $1.pdf$0
    Final Draft     $1.fdx$0
    Highland 2      $1.highland$0

Meander will check the input file extension to ensure the file can be handled.  This cannot be forced.

    $1--raw$0

    raw mode only applies to PDF conversions, and simply forces
    Meander to dump all text exactly as it is found.  Useful
    when the conversion is struggling to re-assemble the output
    correctly or when the input doesn't resemble a screenplay.
