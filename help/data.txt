Data generates a JSON file containing the content of and some additional information about a given Fountain file.

Rather than conversion to other screenplay tools, this is intended for use with non-screenplay software, such as furnishing production-tracking tools with screenplay metadata or dumping statistics into spreadsheets.

$1Usage$0
-----

    meander $1data$0 input_file [output] [--flags]

$1Flags$0
-----

    $1--preserve-markdown$0

    by default, the export will strip *italic*,
    +highlight+, etc. Markdown formatting characters.

    $1--revision$0

    if revision mode is enabled, a $1revised$0
    value can reflect in the content entries.

The resulting JSON blob is a dictionary containing four entries:

    + $1meta$0
    + $1title$0
    + $1characters$0
    + $1content$0

$1Meta$0
----

Meta stores information about the JSON format itself â€” the version of Meander that created it and the version of the format and its structures.

$1Title$0
-----

Title is a simple dictionary of the title page information.  Keys are also sanitised: a key such as $1draft date$0 will become $1draft_date$0.

    "title": {
        "title": "An Movie",
        "credit": "by",
        "author": "Some Nerd",
        "draft_date": "December 2022"
    }

$1Characters$0
----------

Characters is a list of all speaking characters featured in the screenplay with alternate names, gender information and line-count based on the gender definition table.

    "characters": [
        {
            "name": "Ashby",
            "other_names": [
                "Captain Ashby",
            ],
            "gender": "male",
            "lines_spoken": 168
        },
        {
            "name": "Rosemary",
            "gender": "female",
            "lines_spoken": 220
        }
    ]

$1Content$0
-------

Content is a list of all screenplay content, tagged by type.

    "content": [
        {
            "type": "scene",
            "text": "EXT. PORCH - SUNSET",
            "scene_number": "99-A"
        },
        {
            "type": "action",
            "text": "Our heroes watch the sunset..."
        },
        {
            "type": "dialogue",
            "name": "NARRATOR",
            "dialogue": [
                "Will they find peace?",
                "(beat)",
                "Who can say..."
            ]
        },
        {
            "type": "page_break"
        }
    ]

If run with the revision mode flag, any given entry in the data may additionally contain a $1"revised": true$0 value.

The type table is as follows:

    scene
    dialogue
    action
    centered
    transition
    section
    synopsis
    header
    footer
    page_break
    page_number
