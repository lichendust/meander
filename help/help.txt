    meander [command] [input.fountain] [output.pdf] [--flags]

Meander is designed to run as sensibly as possible with as few options as possible:

    + If no command is supplied, Meander will
      render a PDF
    + If no input is supplied, Meander will look
      for a $1.fountain$0 (or $1.ftn$0) file, giving
      priority to ones named $1root$0, $1main$0 or $1manifest$0.
    + If no output is supplied, Meander will swap
      the extension to an appropriate one for the
      chosen command.

All this means you can simply call Meander (with no arguments) in the same location as a single-file screenplay, making generic build systems for text editors extremely easy to configure.
